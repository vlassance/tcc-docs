With the purpose of understanding the impact of the new features for the competitions, we have analyzed the map partitioning strategy by running tests using some of the 2011 RoboCup Rescue Agent Simulation League\footnote{http://roborescue.sourceforge.net/results2011/index.html} maps \cite{artigo-particionamento}.

\end{table}

Given the characteristics of the 5 maps used in the tests and using the number of police agents as the number of sectors, the average number and the standard deviation of entities per sector was calculated for each map. We can see the details in Table 1. Therefore, it is possible to infer from the results that VC and Berlin maps have shapes which are more likely to fit rectangular sectors.

A number of simulations using a team with Map Partitioning and another one without it served as input to the Wilcoxonâ€™s Rank Sum Test, in order to compare some key performance indicators, like the number of civilians found during the whole execution and the step in the simulation the first fire was found.

Even though it was not possible to prove that the improvement was statistically significant, the Map Partioning showed better results in most cases for all metrics. More details can be found in \cite{artigo-particionamento}.
