This paper presented a description of the strategy implemented in the LTI Agent Rescue team for the RoboCup Rescue 2013. The new strategy has some differences from the one implemented for RoboCup 2011 mainly related to the map exploration, the coordination approach, and the communication efficiency. The map exploration proposed is based in a map partitioning technique used to avoid that specific regions of the map stays unexplored. The coordination approach was changed from a hybrid to a distributed one, making the agents completely autonomous on their decisions and actions. The increase on the communication efficiency was obtained by the application of several techniques to avoid channel overload and to allow a better use of the resources available.

Therefore, we expect to have an increase in the teams performance by applying those changes. However, we are still implementing some of those changes and we could not perform a complete comparison analysis with RoboCup 2011 performance. Nevertheless, we surely will have all those changes in place for RoboCup 2013.
