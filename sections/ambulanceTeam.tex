%%
The aim of the Ambulance Team is to rescue the largest number of civilians trapped inside buildings, called victims. In order to succeed in its goal, if the Ambulance Team has no task assigned to act upon, it checks its tasks database and calculates the payoff value related to each task in it. The payoff calculus is the difference between the expected time to rescue the victim and the time of life the victim still have. Then, the Ambulance Team chooses the task with the highest value to act upon. Once a task is selected, the Ambulance Team moves to the victims location, performs the rescue procedure, loads the victim, transports it to the closest unblocked refuge, and unloads the victim.

Usually, the Ambulance Team sticks with the task until the rescue is complete (victim in the refuge), however, some situations may cause the Ambulance Team to give up on the victim and look for other task to act upon, for example if the Ambulance Team cannot reach the victim because all the possible paths are blocked or if the Ambulance Team identifies that the building where the victim is trapped in is on fire.
